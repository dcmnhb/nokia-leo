custom_js: redirect

As you might have heard the news in the past months, there have been some issues over the .io ccTLD, which GitHub uses for their Pages service and is what you're on right now. While the transfer/termination of the domain is gradually and peacefully happening, I don't plan to host this on Pages long-term. Plus I might want to change my username someday, and GitHub won't do redirects for the old username.

Because of this, starting next year, I won’t be publishing nokia-leo on GitHub Pages. You’ll need to access the repository directly on GitHub, and I’ll provide a redirect shortly.
